## Tweeting Together Is Moar Fun!

### Crowdsource Your Twitter

TweetMoar is a sleek, intuitive web application that lets you and your friends or organization share a united voice on Twitter, and harnesses the group's social media power to pump up the volume.

### It's much better, tweeting together. 

Collective tweeting promises to bring out the best in your group of friends or organization. 

###Collective Tweeting Has Arrived

Gone are the days when only one person could serve as the 'designated tweeter'. Now you can crowdsource your tweets, let the desirables behind the scenes to play, and create a collective voice for a single Twitter account.

###Adjust & Amplify Your Message

By scheduling retweets from their own accounts, the group is able to amplify the messages it likes best; administrators can pick rules and setup the program to suit everyone's needs.

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
