### Crowdsource Your Twitter

TweetMoar is a sleek, intuitive web application that lets you and your friends or your organization share a united voice on Twitter. It harnesses the group's social media power to pump up the volume.

### It's much better, tweeting together. 

Collective tweeting has arrived. Gone are the days when only one person could serve as the 'designated tweeter'. Crowdsource your tweets, let the desirables behind the scenes to play, and create a collective voice for a single Twitter account.

###Adjust & Amplify Your Message

By scheduling retweets from their own accounts, the group is able to amplify the messages it likes best; administrators can pick rules and setup the program to suit everyone's needs.



## Toolchain

This project is built with:
* Google App Engine
* Python 2.7
* Jinja 2
* Twitter Bootstrap
* Jquery 1.9
* Unicorn love and wolf lazers



## Versioning

OK, so the project has a way to go before it will be functional. Still, there's a plan for that.

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Tweetmoar will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
